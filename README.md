### How to Submit Updates Using GitHub Desktop
GitHub Desktop is a UI version of the Git tool. You can use this tool instead of the command line to push and pull code.

1. Install GitHub Desktop [here](https://github.com/apps/desktop). This tool will also prompt you to log in or create an account.
2. Copy the GitHub repository link.
3. Connect to the repository using the link option, and paste the copied link.
4. Pull the repository if necessary.
5. Create a new branch and name it something that summarizes your changes.
6. Make changes to the game.
7. In the bottom left-hand side of the app, you will see a commit box. Fill out the inputs and commit your changes.
8. Click the middle button in the top row (it should say something about pushing code).
9. Go to the GitHub website and complete your merge request.
